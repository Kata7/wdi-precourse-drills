		<!-- What I would like to do (for money) -->
		<h1>Career Goals</h1>
			<h2>Primary</h2>
				<p>I would like to learn web development and find a job in the field.</p>
			<h2>Secondary</h2>
				<p>It is my dream to be self-employed.  I think learning web development is going to be my key to achieving this.</p>

	<div id = "Education">
		<!-- What I am learning and how I am doing it -->
		<h1>Education Goals</h1>
			<p>I am currently enrolled at Galvanize, Platte River Campus for the purposes of learning web devlopment.</p>

			<img class = "center" src = "./images/happy.gif" alt = "Homer Simpson" />
			<p class = "center">(Me, shortly after enrolling.  Circa 2018)</p>

			<p>As well, I'm in the process of teaching myself Czech via Duolingo with the goal of one day moving to Europe.  As an aside, I'd recommend against learning Czech or other Slavic languages for fun...as they're quite different from Spanish or German.</p>


	</div>

	<div id = "Personal">
		<!-- What I want out of my life -->
		<h1>Personal Goals</h1>
			<p>I would like to get to the point that I actually enjoy working.  Several of my previous jobs have been excruciatingly boring and it causes me to burn out.  Once I find something that interests me for work (WebDev!) and pays decently well, I'll be pretty much living my ideal life.</p>
